  "description":"<div class=\"userstuff\">\n              <p>A collection of tales, all featuring one very chaotic, very unreasonable Merlin Hermes.</p><p>Ch1</p><blockquote>\n  <p>There is a white bird on Mr Fool\u2019s chair. To be more specific, it is a dove, but it also appeared to be a Beyonder creature.</p>\n  <p>After the Tarot Club had a quick but intense staring competition, it was decided, nonverbally, that the person who would be asking Mr Fool what it was was Miss Justice, who Mr Fool seemed to favor the most after the World.</p>\n  <p>Mr World, on the other hand, seemed to be trying his best not to laugh, Justice Audrey thought, as she opened her mouth to speak.</p>\n  <p>\u201cHonorable Mr Fool,\u201d she began. \u201cMight we inquire as to the nature of the bird next to you?\u201d</p>\n  <p>Out of the corner of her eye, she saw the Hanged Man twitch at the use of \u201cwe\u201d.</p>\n  <p>\u201cOh?\u201d He said, humming slightly. He rapped his knuckles gently on the wood.</p>\n  <p>\u201cThis is my son.\u201d He said, like it was the simplest thing in the world.</p>\n  <p>The white dove with orange eyes blinked back at them, before opening its beak and laughing.</p>\n</blockquote><p>Or: Merlin Hermes crashes into a Tarot Club meeting. Everything goes as well as you would expect, which means not at all.</p>\n            </div>",
