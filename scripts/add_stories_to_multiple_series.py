# First: set up Calibre Fanfic Library so that there are multiple series columns, and you can search across all of them.
# There is a link for this in todoist. :)
# Next: export all fics from calibre that are in a series.
# It looks like, if a fic is in more than one series, we save it into a different series than is added to the epub front
# page by fanficfare.
# So, look for all fics that have more than one series according to that measure?
# Then get the metadata from AO3, and add multiple series to the ebook metadata, and save.
